code purpose:
	This is a demo for user how to use CMOS device driver.
Unfortunately, there are some bugs I can't fix it up.

#BUG1--2014.08.16:

	You know that data store in CMOS register as BCD-code.If you want
to represent it as deciminal, we could transform two-bits BCD-code into
deciminal number by this way:

	Deciminal number = ((BCD-code&0xF0)>>4)*10+(BCD-code)&0x0F;

But there is something strange, it does work in 'second' which in my
code is cmos[0].

	If you have someidea to fix it up, please touch me. Thank you.


#BUG2--2014.08.16:
	
	The day value is smaller than the real time by one day.
Eg:
	Today is 08.16, but it print out 'day:15'.God know it...
